<!-- AREAS DETAILS -->
<h2>Areas of Expertise</h2>
<br>
<p>In simple words, I enjoy using my technical skills to bridge the gap between complex problems and business value creation. This passion for enabling decision-making naturally pushed me to thrive in the data science field.</p>
<br>
<p>My areas of expertise are mainly focused around two areas :</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Data</b>: Data/Decision Science, A.I. deployment, Data Organization</li>
  <li><b>Economics/Finance</b>: Business Strategy, Investment Research, Financial Modeling</li>
</ul>
<p>They both have the need for a deep understanding of the data but also for the ability to take a step back and be curious about the real world.</p>
<br>
<p>
Example of the <b>projects</b> I have been working on :
<ul>
  <li>Management of data analysts and scientists (recruitment process, onboarding, mentoring, etc.)</li>
  <li>Automation of data pipelines and quantitative analyses including executive-level metrics, P&L statements, etc.</li>
  <li>Deployment of A.I. algorithms to automate text data processing and categorization in collaboration with US regulator <a href="www.nhtsa.gov">NHTSA</a></li>

</ul>
